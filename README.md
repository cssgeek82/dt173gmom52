# Webpage to consume a webservice

This code is for a simple webpage that connects to a webservice. The database contains information about the courses that IÂ´m taking at Mittuniversitetet. 

It is possible to read all courses, add a new course and delete a course. 

The webpage is made with HTML, Sass and JavaScript. 

### Webpage link:
